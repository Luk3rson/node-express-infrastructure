## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:-----:|
| capacity\_provider\_strategy | The capacity provider strategy to use for the service. Can be one or more | <pre>list(object({<br>    capacity_provider = string<br>    weight            = number<br>    base              = number<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| cluster | ARN of an ECS cluster | `string` | n/a | yes |
| deployment\_controller | Configuration block containing deployment controller configuration | <pre>list(object({<br>    type = string<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| deployment\_maximum\_percent | The upper limit (as a percentage of the services desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that can be running in a service during a deployment | `number` | n/a | yes |
| deployment\_minimum\_healthy\_percent | The lower limit (as a percentage of the services desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that must remain running and healthy in a service during a deployment | `number` | n/a | yes |
| desired\_count | The number of instances of the task definition to place and keep running. Defaults to 0. Do not specify if using the DAEMON scheduling strategy | `number` | n/a | yes |
| enable\_ecs\_managed\_tags | Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service | `bool` | n/a | yes |
| enabled | Create a new ecs task definition | `bool` | n/a | yes |
| force\_new\_deployment | Enable to force a new task deployment of the service. This can be used to update tasks to use a newer Docker image with same image/tag combination (e.g. myimage:latest), roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version, or immediately deploy ordered\_placement\_strategy and placement\_constraints updates | `bool` | n/a | yes |
| health\_check\_grace\_period\_seconds | Seconds to ignore failing load balancer health checks on newly instantiated tasks to prevent premature shutdown, up to 2147483647. Only valid for services configured to use load balancers | `number` | n/a | yes |
| iam\_role | ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is required if you are using a load balancer with your service, but only if your task definition does not use the awsvpc network mode | `string` | n/a | yes |
| launch\_type | The launch type on which to run your service. The valid values are EC2 and FARGATE | `string` | n/a | yes |
| load\_balancer | A load balancer assosicated with a service | <pre>list(object({<br>    elb_name         = string<br>    target_group_arn = string<br>    container_name   = string<br>    container_port   = number<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| naming\_additional\_attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `policy` or `role`) | `list` | n/a | yes |
| naming\_additional\_tags | Additional tags (e.g. `map('BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`) | `map` | n/a | yes |
| naming\_delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `name`, `namespace`, `stage`, etc. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| naming\_environment\_name | Environment to deploy resources, e.g. 'prod', 'test', 'dev', or 'shared' | `string` | n/a | yes |
| naming\_ext | extension to the full name, e.g. Sequence or additional name | `string` | n/a | yes |
| naming\_oe | Organisational entity name | `string` | n/a | yes |
| naming\_project\_name | Project name if projects has it's own environment | `string` | n/a | yes |
| network\_configuration | The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes | <pre>list(object({<br>    subnets          = list(string)<br>    security_groups  = list(string)<br>    assign_public_ip = bool<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| ordered\_placement\_strategy | Service level strategy rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. List from top to bottom in order of precedence | <pre>list(object({<br>    type  = string<br>    field = string<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| placement\_constraints | Rules that are taken into consideration during task placement | <pre>list(object({<br>    type       = string<br>    expression = string<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| platform\_version | The platform version on which to run your service. Only applicable for launch\_type set to FARGATE | `string` | n/a | yes |
| propagate\_tags | Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks. The valid values are SERVICE and TASK\_DEFINITION | `string` | n/a | yes |
| scheduling\_strategy | The scheduling strategy to use for the service. The valid values are REPLICA and DAEMON. Defaults to REPLICA | `string` | n/a | yes |
| service\_registries | The service discovery registries for the service | <pre>list(object({<br>    registry_arn   = string<br>    port           = number<br>    container_port = number<br>    container_name = string<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| task\_definition | The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task definition that you want to run in your service | `string` | n/a | yes |
